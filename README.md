# nodejs
Here I am using VS code. You can use anyone you want to, its your choice.

Just pull and run the following : npm init,npm install nodemon --save-dev, npm install --save express, npm install --save body-parser, npm install --save ejs pug express-handlebars, 
Nodejs should be installed in it.
Used express; you can use other alternatives like vanilla.

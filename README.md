# nodejs
Learning node, express, mongodb and much more

Just pull learn_play.js and routes.js.
All other will be downloaded automatically when you will execute commands.

Nodejs should be installed in it.(npm will be automatically downloaded and installed)

learn_play.js - main running file(node code)
routes.js - contains routing code which is called by learn_play.js
Used npm :
    Changed scripts-
        npm start
    Installed node modules including nodemon using - "npm install nodemon --save-dev" (installs in current folder only not globally,
                                                                                      use "npm install -g nodemon" to install globally)
    Next time use only npm install to install node modules as your package.json will contain the the nodemon version.

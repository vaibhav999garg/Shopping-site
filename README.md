# nodejs
Here I am using VS code. You can use anyone you want to, its your choice.

Just pull and run the following : npm install
Nodejs should be installed in it.
Used express and sequelize.
You should use your database and your password in database.js to make it work.
For once in starting you can use sync({force:true}) in place of sync() 
    in learn_play.js file to create database files.

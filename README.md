# nodejs
Here I am using VS code. You can use anyone you want to, its your choice.



gJust pull and run the following as it is : 

npm init

npm install nodemon --save-dev

npm install --save express

npm install --save body-parser

npm install --save ejs prg express-handlebars  ==== any one of ejs prg express-handlebars(i have used ejs)

npm install --save mysql2 sequelize ===== optional (not used)

npm install --save mongodb

npm install --save mongoose

npm install --save express--session

npm install --save connect-mongodb-session



Nodejs should be installed in it.
Used express and MongoDB.



Fully working site with mongoose. Login-logout working properly but only with single user.
You should use your database and your password in database.js to make it work.
For once in starting you can use sync({force:true}) in place of sync() 
    in learn_play.js file to create database files.



Just take care that database should be yours - put your credential in link 



Made simple site for shopping.
Will deploy soonðŸ˜ƒ
